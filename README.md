## 👋 Hi there, I'm Jeevarekha K

🎨 **Frontend Developer | UI/UX Designer**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm someone who loves crafting digital experiences that are not only functional but also visually appealing. From pixel-perfect layouts to intuitive interactions, I enjoy transforming ideas into user-centric web solutions. Whether it's designing in Figma or bringing those designs to life with code, I find joy in the creative and technical process of building for the web.
